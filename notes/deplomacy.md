Combat has a cost, so diplomancy is encurage 
each argument is like a summoned creature in magic
you have to attack the individual arguments are distract them
Your main argument is your tank argument, supporting arguments

Or what about a system where you befriend or threaten and then 
do a finishing move where you attempt to successfully perswade them
- so you build up a more powerful chance for success if they have 
- loyal, fearful, or owe you one
  
Bars:
- shared values: religion, culture, goals, honor
- loyal friendship: befriend, charm, genuine compliments, seduce
- purchased reciprocation: gifts, bribes, prestige/noble compliments
- fearful obedience: intimidate, threats, insults, authority, tourchure 

Friendship: befriend them and try to persuade them
Reciprocation: invest in them and then withdraw a favor
Obedience: make them fear you and then give them a command

win them over using
- Cheers: Encourage (confidence), excite (exited), cheer (excited)
- Charms: Impress (impressed), Inspiring course (Confidence), Seduce (impressed), Heartplay
- Compliments: 
  
or scare them away by 
- Insults: Terrify (Terrified), group insult (enraged)
- Taunts: Enrage (enraged), 
- Humiliation: Deride (enraged), sadden, Lecture (sadden)

Emotions: 
- confidence/saddened, excited/enraged, impressed/terrified
- saddened, enraged, terrified

## 
A diplomatic dialoge scene is about domination. Who is dominate? Who wins the scene?
- each actor wants something, and they are in conflict 
- Like a wrestling match, you must pin your opponent and get them to tap out 
- Like poker, however, you don't have to be stronger or actually have good cards
- but only convice your opponent that you do
- Friendly or hostile dialoge: threats, insults, 
- Compromises or compliments bring it back into friendly territory

Tug of war
- strength of arguments sets the inital position: one side favored or in the middle
- actions pull it one way or the other

You should tell me where the artifact is
- has no starting reason to tell you
- so starts out in their favor 
- You offer a bribe, to get them interested and they are susseptable to it
- They still wonder why they should help you?


Body of Argument: starting HP, starting bet in poker
Points: add strength to your argument
Bluff: threaten
if you have information you can use against someone
Raise: 
- threaten, intimidate (with the cards to back it up)
- Bribe, 
Bluffs: 
- attempt to threaten, intimidate (without good cards)
- lie: lie about facts, a bribe, that would convince them 
- blackmail: lie about information
Demand Bribe, Information, 
Posture/Confidence
Hesitate
Interupt/Talk over

Character/Emotion vs Argurment (you can attack either)
Each character must keep their cool in order to win
Affraid/Flight <---> Angry/Fight
- if actor becomes affaid or enraged, they lose the argument 
Friendly <-----> Hostile
- if dialoge becomes hostile, 
    - the argument can not be won
    - if actor is angry, the argument might be lost and their could be a fight
Argument: tug of war
against/disagree <----> for/agree
- if one side fills up, they win


A stronger argument can be beaten by a character attack



## Body of argurment 
hitpoints for your argument 
will + skill successes 

example: 
- Will: B4 => 4
- Oratory Skill: rolls 3 successes
- total: body of argument is 7 


## Skills / Traits (add +1 dice per trait to argument)
Oratory
Ediquette
Ugly Truth 
Command

stubborn
intimidation
Falsehood

## Overview
Build a "Hand" of attack and defense moves
Each round

- volley: play the actions against each other

## Actions

Obfuscate: distract
Feint: Lead them into a trap
Avoid the Topic: veer off topic

Point: main attack
Rebuttal: counter attack

Incite: Insult 
Dismiss: Finishing move

### Counters, countered by, defends against 
Counters: versus test
Counter by: blocked by
Defends against: versus test

## Details =====

### Avoid the Topic: (defends against most attacks)
test: will plus skill
defends against: all except Dismiss
Will Success are subtracted from the oponents attack 

### Dismiss: Finishing move
Conclusion to an argument, I know I've got him cornered
Counter by: Rebuttal
Add +2 dice to skill attack
- if fails, hesitate for the next volley 

### Feint: dummy point and then counter attack
Counters: Rebuttal
Defends against: Obfuscate
Can only counter attack if attacker takes takes the bait


### Incite: (insult)
test: Ugly  truth, intimidation, falsehood, command
Vulnerable to: Points, Dismissals

Obfuscate: (unrelated point, confuse or distract opponent)
tests: Soothing Platitdues, Oratory, Rhetoric, Falsehood, ugly truth
Counters: All but feint
Defends against: All but fient

Point: (main attack)
tests: Dueling skill
counters: Fient, Obufsucate, Insite
Counter By: Rebuttal, Avoid
Success: damage opponents body of argument

Rebuttal: (counter attack)
tests: Dueling skill
Counters: Point, Dismiss

Skill dice is divided between defense and attack
- defense success: minus attackers damage
- attack success: treated as point damage

## Example
alice: point
- 3 successes
bob: rebuttal 
- 2 defend, 4 to counter attack (reposte)

subtract 2D defend from point 3D attack
then roll 4D reposte, and apply damage to arguement
